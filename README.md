This repository showcases my expertise in web development through a comprehensive demo project.

The Project
Simulation Materials API and Minimal Frontend Application

In the realm of computer simulations, the accuracy of material models is critical for realistic results. This demo application provides an interface where engineers can access high-quality material models for free.

The demonstration leverages mock data and frontend templates, which should be replaced with real data and custom designs in a production environment.
