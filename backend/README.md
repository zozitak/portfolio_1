<h2>Backend Development</h2>

<h3>Development process</h3>

My methodology for webapplications is Test Driven Development. </br>

In this Demo, I will build the following steps:

1) Unit test builds with FastAPI, SQLite(as mockup), Pytest (until models and requiered functionalities are ready to test)
2) Integration test builds with Jenkins, PostgreSQL, in a Docker Swarm Environment
3) Basic Smoke test builds to ensure Demo functionalities

<h3>Desired Functionalities</h3>

- User Registration
- User Login
- User Account termination
- User Password recovery
- User Item discovery
- User Item addition
- User Item update
- User Item deletion
- Super User escalation
- Materials with multiple Simulation Softwares
- User Simulation Software discovery

<h3>Portfolio 1 - Backend: Unit testing with Pytest</h3>

1) API Endpoint build with standard http responses
2) CRUD operations with Data Models
3) Implement tests for desired Functionalities
4) Build Functionalities with passing tests

<h3>Portfolio 2 - Backend: Integration test builds with Jenkins</h3>

1) Integration steps collection
2) Integration test cases
3) Integration build (local)
4) Deliver to dev-server

<h3>Portfolio 3 - Backend: Smoke test, Security upgrades, Deployment, Monitoring</h3>

1) Smoketest implemented Functionalities
2) OWASP + BSP84
3) Ansible server provision for deployment
4) Monitoring
